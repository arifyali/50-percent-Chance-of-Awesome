	<div id = "head">Distribution of Race Funding Percent Received by Candidate</div>
	<div id = "description">The two charts describe the distribution of race funding percent received by winner candidates and loser candidates. Each bin is the % of funds (money) each candidate collected in their election. For example, if in Election 1, Candidate A receives $95 and wins, and Candidate B receives $5 and loses, Candidate A will be in the 0.9-1.0 bin on the winner's chart and Candidate B will be in the 0.0-0.1 bin on the loser's chart. There are about 470 elections each election year, and there are normally only 2 candidates for each election. (Sometimes there will only be 1 candidate, sometimes there will be more than 2.)</div>
	<div id = "description">The format of note in x axis is yy-x. Yy represents the year, for example, 04 represents 2004. X represents the bin. For example, 0.1 represent 0~0.1, 0.8 represents 0.7~0.8.</div>
